# Useful Scripts 

## Current state of the repo

> ðŸš¨ just got started 

## Description

The more I develop the more I realise that scripts save me a huge amount of time. 

I don't want to keep  reaching out to StackOverflow everytime I need a new script (although I'll probably still do that), so I'm planning to keep track of some useful scripts here. 

## Contents

- [AWS scripts](./aws.md)

## A bit about me 

Why is this here? Well I want to tell you what I do so that you know what types of scripts you should expect. 

I'm a Fullstack JS Engineer.  

I mainly work with AWS services via Serverless Framework, Typescript, React, and NextJS.

I'm also learning machine learning (Python) and basic networking via CCNA and Juniper. 

I also usually play around with Raspberry Pis so Linux is key for me. 

I care about automation and usually build decoupled, independent systems that can allow for future automation. 

Also spent a huge amount doing frontend and know about optimisations tasks for the web: image compression, svg parsing, video compression, reducing bundle sizes and more.

## Resources I'm thankful for
